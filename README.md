# CODEX

A browser-based puzzle game about reverse-engineering context-free grammars.

### The Game
You are presented with a series of "Target Strings"—sequences of symbols generated by a hidden set of rules. Your goal is to reconstruct those rules.

By dragging and dropping symbols to create logic chains, you must build a grammar that matches the patterns. It is a game of pattern recognition, logic, and syntax. When hovering over a solved pattern, you can see the derivation steps.

### The Tech
CODEX is built entirely in vanilla JavaScript, utilizing no external frameworks or build tools. It mplements the Cocke-Younger-Kasami algorithm to parse user-defined grammars against target strings in real-time.
